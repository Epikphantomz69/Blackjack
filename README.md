Blackjack for APCS

For our final project, after mapping out how it should be implemented, we decided to create a text-based blackjack game. The main goal of our blackjack game is to beat the dealer. The player wins if their first two cards dealt have exactly 21 points without the dealer achieving the same. The player wins if they have a higher sum that the dealer without exceeding 21 points. The player loses if they exceed 21 points or if they have a lower total score than the dealer.
